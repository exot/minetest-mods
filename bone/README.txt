tree_generation based on PilzAdam's farming mod





--USING the mod--

This mod "forces" dirt to drop Bones randomly with rarity = 50 (2%)

The bones can be crafted to bonemeal, which lets grow grass and flowers (remind that flowers are only
in survival and build games are useable).

Furthermore it lets trees grow instantly and supports PilzAdam's farming mod. The wheat, cotton and pumpkin need
a random number of bonemeal to get full grown.
