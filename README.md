A Collection of Minetest Mods
=============================

This is a collection of mods as used by our personal minetest server.  Each mod
is either included as a git-submodule (preferred) or, if that is not possible,
directly contained in this repository.

Some standard extension mods are not included here, because they are shipped
with Debian.  Run the following command to satisfy these dependencies:

```sh
sudo apt install                    \
     minetest-mod-basic-materials   \
     minetest-mod-character-creator \
     minetest-mod-craftguide        \
     minetest-mod-currency          \
     minetest-mod-homedecor         \
     minetest-mod-infinite-chest    \
     minetest-mod-intllib           \
     minetest-mod-mesecons          \
     minetest-mod-mobs-redo         \
     minetest-mod-moreblocks        \
     minetest-mod-moreores          \
     minetest-mod-torches           \
     minetest-mod-unified-inventory \
     minetest-mod-unifieddyes       \
     minetest-mod-worldedit
```

Afterwards, use git to check out all submodules like so:

```sh
git submodule update --init
```

Then start minetest, edit `world.mt` to enable all wanted modules, and restart
again.  Enjoy! â˜º
