A Collection of Minetest Mods
=============================

This is a collection of mods as used by our personal minetest server.  Each mod
is either included as a git-submodule (preferred) or, if that is not possible,
directly contained in this repository.

Some standard extension mods are not included here, because they are shipped
with Debian.  Examples are `basic-materials`, `homedecor`, `infinite-chest`,
`intllib`, `meseconds`, `moreblocks`, `moreores`, `torches`,
`unified-inventory`, `unifieddyes`, and `worldedit`, among others.

For licenses and copyrights see the corresponding mods.  All that remains is
licensed under an MIT License.
