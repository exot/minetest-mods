A Collection of Minetest Mods
=============================

This is a collection of mods as used by our personal minetest server.  Each mod
is either included as a git-submodule (preferred) or, if that is not possible,
directly contained in this repository.  Additionally, local modifications of
certain modes (like disabling particular features) are included as separate
patches in the `patches` directory.  These can be applied with `quilt push -a`
Before updating mods, unapply the patches with `quilt pop -a`.  See also section
on [setting up git](#git-setup) below.

Some standard extension mods are not included here, because they are shipped
with Debian.  Run the following command to satisfy these dependencies:

```sh
sudo apt install                    \
     minetest-mod-character-creator \
     minetest-mod-craftguide        \
     minetest-mod-currency          \
     minetest-mod-infinite-chest    \
     minetest-mod-intllib           \
     minetest-mod-mesecons          \
     minetest-mod-torches           \
     minetest-mod-unified-inventory
```

Afterwards, use git to check out all submodules like so:

```sh
git submodule update --init
```

Then start minetest, edit `world.mt` to enable all wanted modules, and restart
again.  Enjoy! â˜º

-----------------------------------------------------------------

To automatically update a local copy of this git repository on updates, perform
the following configuration

- Make the local copy update its worktree on push, instead of barfing:

  ~~~sh
  git config receive.denyCurrentBranch updateInstead
  ~~~

- Remove `quilt` patches on `pre-receive`, i.e., before receiving updates:

  ~~~sh
  cat <<SCRIPT > .git/hooks/pre-receive
  #!/bin/sh

  quilt pop -a
  SCRIPT
  chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-receive
  ~~~

- After pushing, update all submodules, apply patches, and fix permissions:

  ~~~sh
  cat <<SCRIPT > .git/hooks/post-update
  #!/bin/sh
  
  git submodule update --init
  quilt push -a 
  chmod -R a+rX .
  SCRIPT
  chmod +x .git/hooks/post-update
  ~~~
